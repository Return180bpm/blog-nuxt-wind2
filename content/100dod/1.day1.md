# Day 1

![Content Wind](/day1.png)

## Stuff I did

* Designed several cover images in Figma. 
    *I thought this was a good way to get my juices flowing in the morning*
* Tried to set up several SSGs to start this blog  
    *The humanity*
* Started making a mental list of things I want to achieve in these 100 days
    *Does it count if it's exclusively mental?*
